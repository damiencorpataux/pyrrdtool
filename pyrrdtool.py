# The purpose of thie rrdtool-cli facade library is to make
# the configuration of rrd creation, update and graph easier and faster.
#
# By enabling the user to create definitions of rrdatabases, datasouces
# and graphs that are reusable for creating, updating and graphing
# a wide variety of graphs,  easily and with peace of mind.
#
# Also, it eases the definition of DS, RRA and graph configurations,
# and makes them reusable - that is the point of that library.
# E.g. the user can graphe multiple graphs of multiple sources
# with multiple style by reusing Database, DataSource and GraphData.
#
#Â Global FIXMEs:
# - Reuse the cli doc option definitions in classes variables doc
#   (with useful links to rrdtool apidoc?)
